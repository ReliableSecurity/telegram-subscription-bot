# Replit.md - Telegram Bot Payment System

## Overview

This is a Telegram bot application with a payment system that allows chat/channel administrators to pay for subscriptions or additional features directly through Telegram. The system includes a web dashboard for administration and uses Telegram's built-in payment API with support for various payment providers.

## User Preferences

Preferred communication style: Simple, everyday language.

## System Architecture

### Backend Architecture
- **Language**: Go (Golang)
- **Bot Framework**: Telegram Bot API integration
- **Payment System**: Telegram's native payment API (`sendInvoice`) with support for multiple payment providers (Stripe, YooMoney, PayPal)
- **Web Server**: HTTP server for dashboard interface with authentication
- **Authentication**: Token-based login system with configurable admin credentials

### Frontend Architecture
- **Dashboard**: HTML/CSS/JavaScript web interface with multi-page navigation
- **Login System**: Secure authentication with admin/admin123 default credentials
- **Setup Guide**: Comprehensive configuration and deployment instructions
- **Styling**: Custom CSS with gradient designs and Font Awesome icons
- **Charts**: Chart.js for analytics visualization
- **Responsive Design**: Mobile-friendly interface

### Data Architecture
- **Database**: Likely using a relational database (structure suggests support for user management, payments, and subscriptions)
- **ORM**: Potentially using Drizzle ORM (based on note about Drizzle usage)

## Key Components

### 1. Telegram Bot Commands
- `/plans` - Display available subscription tiers and pricing
- `/subscribe` - Choose and pay for subscription plan
- `/myplan` - Show current subscription status and expiration
- `/cancel` - Cancel active subscription
- `/setup` - Comprehensive bot setup and configuration instructions
- `/addbot` - Step-by-step guide for adding bot to groups and channels

### 2. Payment System
- **Subscription Tiers**: 
  - Free basic plan (limited features)
  - Paid tiers based on group/channel count, time duration, or premium features
  - One-time services (unblock quarantine, expand limits, integrations)

### 3. Web Dashboard
- **Authentication**: Secure login system with token-based authentication
- **Default Credentials**: admin / admin123 (changeable via web interface)
- **Main Sections**:
  - Overview: General statistics and metrics
  - Users: User management and status
  - Payments: Transaction history and payment management
  - Plans: Subscription plan management
  - Analytics: Charts and data visualization
  - System: System status and configuration
- **Setup Guide**: Comprehensive configuration instructions and troubleshooting
- **Password Management**: Secure password change functionality

### 4. User Management
- User subscription tracking
- Payment history logging
- Group/channel association management

## Data Flow

1. **Subscription Purchase Flow**:
   - User requests plans via `/plans` command
   - Bot displays available tiers with payment buttons
   - User selects plan, bot sends invoice via `sendInvoice`
   - Payment processed through Telegram's payment interface
   - Upon successful payment, subscription is activated/extended
   - Transaction logged in database

2. **Dashboard Data Flow**:
   - Web dashboard fetches data from backend API
   - Real-time updates through refresh functionality
   - Charts and analytics generated from stored transaction data

## External Dependencies

### Payment Providers
- **Stripe**: Credit card processing
- **YooMoney**: Russian payment system
- **PayPal**: International payments
- **Telegram Payments API**: Core payment infrastructure

### Frontend Libraries
- **Chart.js**: Data visualization and analytics charts
- **Font Awesome**: Icons and UI elements

### Bot Infrastructure
- **Telegram Bot API**: Core bot functionality
- **Webhook/Polling**: Message handling from Telegram

## Deployment Strategy

### Environment Setup
- Go runtime environment
- Web server configuration for dashboard
- Database setup (likely PostgreSQL based on typical Drizzle usage)
- SSL/TLS certificates for secure payments

### Configuration Requirements
- Telegram Bot Token (via .env file or environment variables)
- Payment provider API keys and credentials
- Database connection strings (PostgreSQL)
- Web server port configuration (default: 5000)
- Admin credentials (default: admin/admin123 - changeable via web interface)

### Security Considerations
- Secure payment processing through Telegram's verified system
- Transaction logging and audit trails
- User authentication for dashboard access
- HTTPS enforcement for web interface

The system is designed to be a comprehensive subscription management platform with both bot-based user interaction and web-based administrative control, focusing on monetization through Telegram's native payment ecosystem.
